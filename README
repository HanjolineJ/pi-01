Raspberry Pi Assembly LED Control

This project assembly on Pi 1 to control the ACT LED via GPIO16.
-  GPIO16 as output
- ACT LED triggered by clearing GPIO16.
- An infinite loop is added to prevent the CPU from executing anthing else

Build Instructions:
 Run `make` to assemble and link the code, generating `kernel.img`.
Copy `kernel.img` to your Raspberry Pi's SD card to boot.
Put SD in pi before plugging in power source

Change Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO registers in assembly to control the ACT LED, to understand operating systems hardware interactions for programming and debugging.
